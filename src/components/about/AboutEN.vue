      Sexism is a phenomenon underlying inequalities between men and women and violence towards
      women. Among the forms taken by sexism, ordinary/everyday sexism has impacts on self-esteem,
      anxiety level and overall well-being.

    <p>
      To fight against the effects of this everyday/ordinary sexism, this application aims to :
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide a simple view of the level of exposure</li>
      <li>
        Share the reviews in order to obtain social support, and allow others to become aware of
        the phenomenon and thus act against it
      </li>
      <li>
        Contribute to research by authorizing the transmission of these data to researchers.
      </li>
    </ul>
